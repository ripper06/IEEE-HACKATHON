## Project Name: ECOHARVEST ##

 *Theme :*
 EcoHarvest is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between surplus food providers and individuals or organizations in need. Its core idea is to create an efficient and user-friendly system where surplus food, which might otherwise go to waste, can be redirected to those who can benefit from it to a particular location range.
