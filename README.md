# Project Name: ECOHARVEST #

### 1. Theme : ###
 * EcoHarvest is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between surplus food providers and 
   individuals or organizations in need. Its core idea is to create an efficient and user-friendly system 
   where surplus food, which might otherwise go to waste, can be redirected to those who can benefit from 
   it to a particular location range.
 * It is built to serve 3 main purposes i.e.  **serving society, job generation and business  development**.
 * EcoHarvest promotes sustainable practices by encouraging individuals, businesses, and organizations to 
   participate actively in reducing food waste. It fosters a culture of waste reduction and responsible 
   consumption.

### 2. Uniqueness: ###
 * Our platform has the potential to address this critical issue head-on. By efficiently redistributing 
  surplus food to those in need, we aspire to eliminate both food wastage and hunger simultaneously. This 
  dual-purpose approach not only tackles a major societal problem but also aligns with our mission to 
  create a more sustainable and equitable food system.
* In addition to food redistribution, we plan to collaborate with composting partners to convert non- 
  consumable food waste into valuable compost. This compost will be made available to farmers at an 
  affordable price, enhancing soil fertility and promoting sustainable agriculture practices and also 
  generate a revenue.
* Furthermore, we recognize the opportunity to generate revenue and create a sustainable business model. By 
  providing a delivery service for food donations, we bridge the accessibility gap between food donors and 
  recipients. This not only makes the process more convenient but also allows us to operate as a viable 
  business.
* Ultimately, our holistic approach not only addresses food wastage and hunger but also contributes to 
  employability generation and the establishment of a self-sustaining business model. We envision a future 
  where EcoHarvest not only reduces food waste but also serves as a catalyst for positive change within 
  India's food ecosystem.
